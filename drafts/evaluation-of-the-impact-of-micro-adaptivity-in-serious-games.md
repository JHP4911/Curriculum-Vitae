## Abstract

As more and more computing becomes about ubiquitous personal mobile platforms like iPhone, iPad, Nintendo DS, Android, and many ﬂavors of mobile phones & tablets, the opportunities to create unique serious games is more possible then ever before.

Imagine if your child learns maths with assistance through playing, so you can lean back and spare you a Lerner and forward effort. Imagine if we could combine the gameplay with all the enjoyment & motivation in it and the learning with all the difﬁculties that children could encounter in their ﬁrst steps; bringing out a serious game on the iPad.

With assistance we, “Dance Research Group”, mean that: based on the theory of the zone of Proximal Development [Vygotsky's Psychological and Pedagogical patterns], learns your child more with a little help when needed, what we call further “dynamic adaptivity”; this approach let the game adapt himself to the abilities of your child giving him the favor to enjoy the game and learn implicit and effectively.

# Part I

## Introduction 

> Research into questions posed by scientiﬁc theories and hypotheses.  

> Beginning with introspection, ﬁnishing with theories.  

### 1.1 philosophy

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of adaptivity which we would integrate in a serious game designed on the iPad for preschool children aged from 4 to 8.  
Evaluation relies on objectivity, otherwise the outcomes wouldn't be neither valid nor reliable.   

### 1.2 overview of the scientific research

We work from the assumption that the wealth of an intensive comprehensive literature research would provide us with principal guidelines for the design of both of the game and the evaluation framework.  

First I tried to answer the questions:  

- What are Serious Games?
- How serious are they?
- How are Serious games of the 21st Century?
- Conducting so an Exploratory and Descriptive Research.

After having acquired a grounded theory about serious games and searching for design and evaluation guidelines, I reviewed an intensive literature about Serious Games Research.  
But a general framework were never designed.  
Conducting so a Conﬁrmative, Explanatory and Comparative Research
Exploratory studies are essential whenever a researcher is breaking new ground, and they canalmost always yieldnew in-sights into atopic for research.

### 1.3 problem

- How to assess the value of Serious Games?
- What does the formal K12 assessment industry think about the use of games?
- Where have games developed for Research shown promise regarding games as an assessment tool?
- What do game designers think about the concept of assessment in games?
- What can game structures tell us about formative assessment, or assessment for learning?

### 1.4 purpose

In order to integrate adaptivity in our mathematics digital game —

seeking the crucial balance between fun and education —, we would

investigate the impact and/or the effect of each adaptive variable on

the behaviour and emotions of children playing with it (Gameplay,

Challenges in Game, Game Environment, Children´s Motivation, Chil-

dren Skills´Acquisition, ...).

1.5 research questions

What can be observed when a learner plays a serious game and how

can this information be used to characterize the individual learner?

What can a tutor observe when watching a learner playing a serious

game?

How can this information be used to characterize the individual

learner?

How can a tutor use the observed information to recognize and rate

a skill of a learner?

What are changes that need to be applied to a serious game (while

playing) to change the difﬁculty of the tasks based on the Knowledge

Space Theory?

How would experts apply non-invasive help to a serious game by

just observing learners? How can this task be formalized?

For being able to design a system that can behave as a human tutor

in the way ZPD is deﬁned, we need to transfer the help-methods given

by tutors in direct way to learnars, into help that is applied in a serious

game.

1.6 outline

The difference between this two cases is, that in games we do not

want to interrupt the learner.

Therefore we need to ﬁnd out a way to apply this help in a non-

invasive way.

How can a serious game be individualized to each student individ-

ually? How can a serious game be automatically adjusted for each

individual learner to have just the right amount of challenge for both:

learning and game elements ?

What is the impact of (auto-applied) adaptivity in serious games in

comparison to the help given directly by the human?

S TAT E O F T H E A RT: S E R I O U S G A M E S

R E S E A R C H

The Scientiﬁc Research world contains a rich tapestry of

variation that almost makes you want to pull your hair out!

Scientiﬁc research is deﬁned by the strategy of understand-

ing how everything works through logical thinking.

S E R I O U S G A M E S

Although the deﬁnitions differ among researchers, if i would deﬁne

Serious games, in the 21st Century, I would cite Clark Abt’s deﬁnition

from 1970.

Serious games are games that:

“have an explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose and

are not intended to be played primarily for amusement.

This does not mean that serious games are not, or should not be,

entertaining.” (Abt 1970)

2.1 history and evolution

In general play occupy an important part of most children’s leisure

time and an important part of our culture as a whole.

In the last twenty years and due to the quick advance in mobile

thechnologies, play was replaced by computer games, ranging from

play consoles to educational software on mobile devices such as smart-

phones and tablets.

Therefore developpers have struggled to present a substantial amount

of content and context without sacriﬁcing the degree of control game

players expect.

But we should never think that serious games are about putting

learning courses into a game or as a delivery of formal learning.

The main reason why we play games remains fun.

Otherwise, if we adopt a broad deﬁnition of learning like problem

solving, creativity, information access, collaboration, innovation, ex-

perimentation, and more, we could admit that serious games promote

implicit learning.

2.2 arts of serious games

Throughout my literature review, several classiﬁcations of serious

games can be found that do not meet a general consensus among

researchers.

But we can classify serious games in the following seven categories:

• Action Games (interactive gameplay requiring fast reﬂexes and

hand-eye coordination).

• Role-Playing Games (interactive fantasy gameplay requiring

planning).

• Strategy Games (requiring analytical thinking, reasoning and

planning).

• Adventure Games (interactively experiencing narratives with

cognitive/reasoning aspects).

• Simulation Games (replay real or ﬁctitious situations).

• Puzzle Games (matching or constructive puzzles).

• Educational Games (games developed for educational purposes);

Games that teach through lively activities combining education

with entertainment called Edutainment (Yanhong, Liming & Li-

fang, 2010).

This combination transforms the game into an effective tool for

educational purposes, with elements such as immediate feed-

back, interactivity, and challenge (Annetta et al., 2006; Amr, 2007;

Yusoff, 2010).

2.3

serious games background

Next to Fun, Motivation, Engagement, Brain Health and Play itself —

Gameplay basics and rules —

A serious game won´t be considered as serious and won´t fulﬁll an

educational goal, if we wouldn´t pedagogically assign the learning

content to the gaming experience.

2.3 serious games background

2.3.1 Motivation, Fun & Engagement

In the jargon of today’s young generation, gameplay rules; Why? Be-

cause gameplay motivates, so simple as that.

Serious games can motivate players by providing them with appro-

priate levels of challenge, curiosity, control, and fantasy.

The motivation is on his turn associated with fun, the great motiva-

tor in games, which is the result of the positive feedback players get

from a game.

Since we are dealing here with digital educational games, not in

general with games;

dare I ask – could we combine fun & learning?

Without being able to deﬁne either “fun” or “learning” speciﬁcally,

can we say anything about the relationship between them.

Does having fun hurt learning, or help it?

Some researchers have looked at this:

• Rose and Nicholl, 1998 admitted that:

“In simple terms a brain enjoying itself is functioning more efﬁ-

ciently.”

“When we enjoy learning, we learn better.”

• Bisson and Luckner, 1996 appreciated that:

“Enjoyment and fun as part of the learning process are impor-

tant when learning new tools since the learner is relaxed and

motivated and therefore more willing to learn.”

“The role that fun plays with regard to intrinsic motivation in

education is twofold. First, intrinsic motivation promotes the de-

sire for recurrence of the experience. Secondly, fun can motivate

learners to engage themselves in activities with which they have

little or no previous experience.”

So fun in the learning process relaxes, motivate and engage in further

tasks.

Relaxation enables learners to take things in more easily; motivation

enables them to put forth effort without resentment.

serious games

Our next big deal is effectively; How can we garantie more gameplay

— continuous, appropriate challenge — into the educational process?

2.3.2 Pedagogical Background

Games, being the language of young generation children — till they

are enrolled ﬁrst in kindergarten or later in schools — can be useful

in enhancing memory capacity, in concentration of attention and in

the problem solving strategies of young children, which can indirectly

affect their academic achievements.

This encouraged many researchers appealing to embed games

within the curriculum and focusing on the need for pedagogical

support during gaming as well as during learning, what we normally

have.

The seriousness in serious games, as we can see from Figure 3 on

page 15, stems from the close collaboration and cooperation between

game developers and experts to conceive games with well dosed

learning content and responding to the psychological states of young

children.

But games by themselves have been approoved by both educational

researchers, experts and game developers as a great potential learning

tool, because games invoke intense engagement in learners, encour-

age active learning or learning by doing, foster collaboration among

learners, increase likelihood of knowledge acquisition and knowledge

application, enhance understanding of complex and abstract phenom-

ena, and cater to the individual learner’s needs.

2.3.3 Psychological Background

Developmental psychology provides us with an extensive knowledge

and research based on children’s development.

I would limit my concentration on two of the main aspects: Brain

health and Play itself.

1. To Brain Health, as a pattern;

Just like a muscle, if used regularly, it can be kept ﬁt.

A regular play of brain challenging games can contribute to

brain health.

Our brains are good enough at pattern matching and executive

monitoring.

The essential goal from the gaming experience is letting us prac-

tice what our brains do well and providing support for what our

brains do not do well.

2. To Play, as a powerful mediator for learning;

Early childhood educators know how important play is in chil-

dren’s lives. Play is not only an enjoyable, spontaneous, self-

initiated and self-regulated activity of young children, which

is relatively risk free and not necessarily goal-oriented. Play is

intrinsically motivated: normally children have an internal de-

sire and interest to engage in play, they are actively involved in

creating their play and are in control of it.

The toys and gestures with which children play are seen to be

signiﬁcant artefacts from their social and cultural settings — so,

in play, children are acquiring the tools and meanings of their

culture —

All of the researchers, each on his way, assigned Play a signiﬁ-

cant role in the growing of children’s minds.

• Researchers like (Groos 1898, 1901) have even admitted that

play prepares children for adulthood, due to the develop-

ment of physical and mental capacities that will serve them

as adults.

• Others like (Vygotsky 1977, 1978) view play as the most

signiﬁcant leading activity of the early childhood years,

what in other terms means that the most signiﬁcant psycho-

logical achievements of the early childhood age occur while

children engage in play and this promotes spontaneous

learning.

• A German philosopher, (Schiller, 1879), deﬁned play as “the

aimless expenditure of exuberant energy” where the Recre-

ation or Relaxation play theory stems from.

• Further more Leo Buscaglia have seen it paradoxical, that

many educators and parents still differentiate between a

time for learning and a time for play. Without seeing the

vital connection between them.

Adaptive vs.

Generative

D E S I G N E S S E N T I A L S

More and more serious games researchers, appreciated by the beneﬁt

from the child computer interaction and the birth of new interactive

technologies, aim to present educational content in a playful way, even

to adapt the learning experience to the pedagogical needs of each

pupil making from these digital educational games effective teaching

tools.

Towards a new Era of gaming and learning experience, many psy-

chological and pedagogical theories have been adopted to the ﬁeld of

serious games, what aid researchers and developers to better under-

stand the cognitive and emotional development of young generation

players.

3.1 notion of adaptivity

The gaming experience varies from player to another, from age to an-

other, from gender to another, from a cultural background to another;

and this, in fact, have led to the birth of the notion of adaptivity.

By adaptivity, i mean that the learning or/and gaming experience is

adjusted, both in concept and form to the current needs and abilities,

what we later call skills for the further of the thesis, of each pupil

individually.

Later on, as the player evolues with the gaming experience and

acquires more and more skills, the game engine creates adequate

learning content and new game events, as it progresses; hereby adopt

adaptivity the generative mode.

A more scientiﬁc deﬁnition of Adaptivity would be Damir Ismailovi´c

[78]´s, as he deﬁnes an

“adaptive serious game as a game that implements the Adaptivity

approach.”

and clariﬁes this approch as:

“a non-invasive approach that enables a serious game to learn from

learner´s behavior by intelligently monitoring and interpreting

design essentials

- So stands adaptivity

for higher

individuality.

learner´s actions in the game´s environment and adjusts automatically

learning and game elements according to the student´s individual

ZPD as necessary.”

Where we note, that Adaptivity describes in this deﬁnition the

following factors:

• non-invasiveness: Does not disrupt the gaming experience.

• intelligent monitoring Behavior (in form of Action) is observed

while playing in a non-invasive manner.

• interpreting learner’s actions: We can interpret this in the fol-

lowing way: The system can recognize the learner’s skills based

on the Knowledge Space Theory.

• ability to learn from experience: Learning from behavior.

• adaptive intervention: Adjusts automatically learning and game

elements.

Further Ismailovi´c [78] describes adaptive serious games a system that

possesses a special adaptive behavior that helps it to adapt to the ZPD

of the learner with the possibility to learn from experience.

A new milestone in the technology evolution have been ﬁnalized.

Nowadays technology provide us with environments that can be

adapted to the individual player/learner, what makes the experience

personal, unique and contextualized.

This encouraged the game developers to develop digital educational

games that support a personalized learning experience by adapting the

game´s story to individual preferences, by providing the possibility of

explorative learning processes, by enabling the realization of different

stories and entirely different game situations, also for a variety of

different learning domains based on more or less the same pool of

story units, patterns and structures as well as learning and gaming

concepts and elements/objects.

3.2

flow theory

Games wouldn´t be interesting for their players, if they don´t enjoy

them.

Furthermore a serious game with a learning goal wouldn´t be bene-

ﬁt, if the player doesn´t plunge enough into the game and focus on

the didactic goals of the game.

3.2 flow theory

Figure 4: The ﬂow channel of Pomper et al. [144]

Concentration and Motivation, the driving forces behind our ac-

tions, are seen as aspects that contribute to the player immersion upon

an event or a task, what pushed the psychologist Mihály Csíkszent-

mihályi to outline his theory of Flow —Figure 4 on page 19— as follow:

“People are most happy when they are in a state of ﬂow— a state of

concentration or complete absorption with the activity at hand and

the situation. It is a state in which people are so involved in an

activity that nothing else seems to matter.”1

Further he deﬁnes Flow as the ultimate state of immersion.

Game designers refer to the Flow Theory, to develop serious games

that stimulates the attention and actions of the players, in order to

keep them focused and motivated at play and so to make the gaming

experience playable and enjoyable.

According to this theory a player will stay immersed in the Flow

channel when he constantly experiences the right balance between the

challenges of the game and his own skills.

design essentials

For this reason a serious game has to be designed in such a way

that it constantly adapts the challenge to the skills of the player.

Game designers deﬁne the ﬂow channel as the optimal gameplay

corridor as shown on Figure 5 on page 21.

Pomper et al. [144] noticed even that:

“When the challenge gets relatively too high, anxiety is the result,

whereas boredom results from the players skill level being much

higher than needed to overcome the challenges of the game. “

3.3 assissted performance by vygotsky

3.3.1 Zone of Proximal Development

The socio-cultural notion of proximal development is probably one of

the most famous concepts introduced by Vygotsky, a Soviet psycholo-

gist.

Initially he used the concept as an index for intellectual potential,

arguing that developmental potential cannot be assessed in absolute

terms for example by a score on an intelligence test: it should be based

on what a child can learn under optimal conditions for example with

assistance.

The zone developed into an educational concept.

The zone is a shared activity, collaboratively produced in the inter-

action between a child and more knowledgeable others – imitation,

though not to be confused with copying.

In short terms, Zone of Proximal Development is deﬁned as:

“the difference between what a learner can do without help and what

he or she can do with help, the difference between a child´s actual

and potential levels of development.”

In technical terms;

“ZPD is the distance between the actual developmental level as

determined by independent problem solving and the level of potetial

development as determined through problem solving under adult

guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.”

- In Vygotsky’s words,

- “what the child is

able to do in

- collaboration today

- he will be able to do

independently

tomorrow”

- (Vygotsky, 1987, p.

211).

3.3 assissted performance by vygotsky

Figure 5: The Flow Theory Masuch [121]

![Im6](images/Im6)

design essentials

Assisted performance deﬁnes what a learner can do with help, with

the support of the environment, of others and of the self.

The contrast between assisted performance and unassisted perfor-

mance identiﬁed the fundamental nexus of development and learning

that Vygotsky describes as the zone of proximal development.

Distinguishing the proximal zone from the developmental level by

contrasting assisted versus unassisted performance is of major impor-

tance in understanding approaches to education.

It is in the proximal zone that teaching may be deﬁned in terms of

learner development.

Vygotsky stated that:

“Teaching is good only when it awakens and rouses to life those

functions which are in a stage of maturing, which lie in the zone of

proximal development.”

Consequently, teaching consists in assisting performance through

the ZPD.

Teaching can be said to occur when assistance is offered at points in

the ZPD at which performance requires assistance.

3.3.2 Scaffolding Theory

The Scaffolding Theory, ﬁrst introduced in the late 1950s by Jerome

Bruner, a cognitive psychologist, relies on the provision of sufﬁcient

support to promote learning when concepts and skills are being ﬁrst

introduced to students. (Wikipedia)

Verenikina [193] — in her published Article 2 — presented an anal-

ysis of the metaphor of scaffolding in its connection to the Vygotskian

concept of the zone of proximal development.

These two metaphors closely resemble notionally.

We can admit, as shown on Figure 6 on page 23, that the zone of

proximal development deﬁnes the bounds where scaffolding is indeed

needed.

2 Verenikina, Irina, "Understanding Scaffolding and the ZPD in Educational Research",

Faculty of Education, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia (2004).[193]

3.3 assissted performance by vygotsky

Figure 6: ZPD & Scaffolding towards a better performance. (Google)

![Im7](images/Im7)

design essentials

Further the Scaffolding theory awares of both engagement & learn-

ing since the challenge must be neither too easy (promoting boredom)

nor too hard (discouraging continued play).

3.4 adaptivity approaches

As learning is optimized when the difﬁculty of the activity lies in the

learner’s zone of proximal development, where it is a challenge for

the learner, but can still be accomplished with scaffolding via hints,

suggestions or task and/or event adaptation to suit the learner.

Adaptation Techniques can take many forms like audio tutorial,

poupup hints, manipulation of tasks/events difﬁculties, or even build-

ing a complete new game environment.

But The basic idea of the daptivity concept remains to provide the

learner with appropriate educational support without corrupting im-

mersion and the ﬂow of the gaming experience.

Tutoring systems focus on procedures, constrain students to particular

problem solving paths and eventually provide answers to problems

instead of letting students attempt solutions and learn from their mis-

takes.

The primary focus of interest of the macroadaptive approach is the

sequencing of learning objects.

Replacing learning goals or changing the level of detail and the

delivery system are exemplary factors of macro-adaption.

Observed attributes of the learner include learning styles, motiva-

tion, previous knowledge and personality -[78].

While macro-adaption employs a global view on the learning process,

concentrating on the whole curriculum, micro-adaption tries to contin-

smaller units -[78].

R E S E A R C H T R E N D S

The purpose of this section is to provide an overview about research

conducted on effects of instructional digital games.

non-empirical orliterature review vs.empirical researchThe literature has a wealth of articles suggesting ways that Games-

Based Learning can be evaluated in terms of particular areas with par-

ticular measurements, experimental designs and analytical techniques.

But little has been published about serious games with mathematical

learning content.

The ﬁndings revealed that research investigated learning effect of

the games from various perspectives by using different research meth-

ods.

A number of non-empirical studies were found that examined the

effect of instructional games by using the results of reported research

to analyze, compare and integrate the ﬁndings and reach a conclusion.

The signiﬁcance of the literature reviews is that they provide an

overview about the effect of the games based on reviewing of a rela-

tively large number of articles.

4.1 assessment for games

As with any other traditional educational intervention, games for

learning will need to be evaluated to ensure that they help learning

and that they do what we await from them.

In serious games, assessments are used to measure whether or not

the product does the job, teaches the required skills, and changes be-

havior. More important than that, assessment testing should measure

whether or not those skills and behaviors transfer to the real world.

Assessment testing will tell the client whether or not the serious

game was worth the cost of investment. We should note that instruc-

tional designers typically use the term summative evaluations for these

assessments. The other form of assessment would be the formative

assessment to test the design and behavior of a system as it progresses,

generally performed by computer scientists, system designers and

research trends

developers.

- Why engage in

Assessment?

Review of research indicates assessment techniques, both standard-

ized and informal have been, and will remain, an important tool for

early childhood professionals.

Assessment methods can be used to screen players´ skills, to assess

children performance over the game story, to assist in integrating

games with learning intention within the curriculum and daily ac-

tivities, to evaluate the effectiveness of the game, and/or to provide

feedback to parents, clients and developers.

4.2 methodology guidelines

According to many researchers in the ﬁeld of Game-based Learning,

we should employ mixed, parallel methods to produce the most con-

vincing body of evidence and to achieve triangulation of data.

Therefore, qualitative case studies were conducted as the dominant

paradigm in order to investigate the phenomenon of serious games

within its real-life context.

Further quantitative procedures were employed to corroborate and

extend the primarily qualitative approach.

Qualitatively, interviews and questionnaires with those who have

participated directly in the design and implementation of the gaming

solution would be ﬁrst conducted.

Then in-ﬁeld observation of the gaming experience should deliver

us with needed theories.

Quantitatively, a within-group pretest–posttest comparison or two-

groups comparaison would investigate if the children performance

level improved through the played serious game.

Bowers [15] — in her published article1 — have dealed with the

question of

- Which measures

- should i select, if i

- would evaluate?

“Which measures should i select, if i would evaluate?”

and admitted that one of the most confusing aspects of assessment

is choosing which method(s) to use.

1 Bowers, Susan, "Assessing Young Children: Whats Old, Whats New, and Where Are

We Headed?" (2007), 5.

4.2 methodology guidelines

Traditional

Standardized TestsInformal Methodslike ObservationFurther she grouped Assessment measures into two categories:

1. The ﬁrst category includes standardized tests and inventories

that are available for purchase and used primarily to compare

children against developmental norms or to other children.

Today, hundreds of standardized tests exist, with the majority

being designed for use by persons speciﬁcally trained in their

use and interpretation.

Studies suggest early childhood professionals tend to choose

standardized tests that are already being used by others (Johnson

& Beauchamp, 1987).

2. The second category consists of informal methods.

Observations may be obtained from informal methods in a me-

thodical way, but the results are not usually compared to stan-

dardized norms or averages.

Many individuals in early childhood rely on a combination of

assessment methods, including some of the common informal

methods, as well, as a source of collecting data about young

children.

4.2.1 Standardized Tests and Inventories

One of the major advantages of standardized tests is that the results

can be used to compare a child to developmental norms or to children

in similar circumstances.

A norm is an average or series of averages obtained on the sample

of children used in developing the test.

A second advantage sometimes cited is the predictive validity of

such tests.

That is, children who perform well on standardized tests in the

preschool years tend to also perform well on tests in kindergarten and

in the early elementary years (Vacc, Vacc, & Fogleman, 1987).

Common tests for preschoolers include the Battelle (Newborg, Stock,

& Wnek, 1984), the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1992), the

DIAL-R (Mardell-Czudnowski & Goldenberg, 1990), the Miller As-

sessment for Preschoolers (Miller, 1982), the Peabody Developmental

Motor Scales (Folio & Fewell, 1984) and the Peabody Picture Vocabu-

lary Test (Dunn & Dunn, 1981). Tests often used with infants include

the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley, 1993), and the Denver

research trends

Developmental Screening Test (Frankenburg et al., 1975).

One of the major disadvantages of standardized tests is how to

interpret the data obtained. Results from administration of such tests

must be considered in comparison to similar children in similar cir-

cumstances. Often, this comparison is relatively difﬁcult to achieve.

The predictive validity of standardized tests, that is their ability to

forecast achievement in kindergarten, may not be the most important

variable we want to know (Pilkington, 1988; Quay & Steele, 1998; Rud-

ner, 1996).

More and more, alternatives to formal tests are being explored,

including measures which are thought to be more holistic and devel-

opmentally appropriate in their focus and approach.

Standardized tests are accompanied by information regarding their

validity and reliability.

Validity information, indicating whether the test really “measures

what it is supposed to measure,” (Witt, Elliott, Kramer & Gresham,

1994, p. 103) offers teachers the opportunity to evaluate whether the

test is appropriate for its intended use.

Reliability information, indicating the test’s ability to produce “the

same result when repeatedly measuring the same thing,” (Witt et al.,

1994, p. 95) helps determine a teacher’s degree of conﬁdence in the

information that will be obtained. Information on both validity and

reliability can be found in the manual that accompanies the test when

purchased.

4.2.2 Selecting Informal Methods

The criteria used for selecting any method should be based on the

purpose of the assessment itself.

Questions asked prior to engaging in assessment should include:

• Why do I need this information?

• What is the purpose of my efforts?

• Based on what I need to know, what kind of information will be

helpful? Test scores? Written records? Works found in a portfo-

4.3 challenge

lio?

• How often and when do I need to collect such information, and

how can I best assure the information is accurate and valid? In

addition, any method used should be selected for its appropri-

ateness for the children on whom it will be used.

• Two important criteria are developmental appropriateness, e.g.,

“Is it designed for the age of child I’m testing?” and cultural

appropriateness, e.g., “Is it relevant to the background and daily

circumstances of the child?”

To some extent, any method is only as good as the person performing

it.

Thus, assessments are most appropriate when every effort has been

made to insure objectivity (Salvia & Ysseldyke, 1995).

Objectivity refers to the process of examining a child or event with-

out pre-formed ideas about outcome. When we are objective we report

only the facts, and, in turn, interpret those facts based only on what

was observed, rather than feelings or attitudes about the child.

An innovative method is play-based assessment, which evaluates

children’s developmental skills and their social interactions, learning

styles and behaviors through play (Lowenthal, 1997) - [15].

4.3 challenge

Law and Rust-kickmeier [108] — through the Elektra project — have

admitted that:

“Three major challenges for developing and evaluating immersive

digital educational games (DEGs) are identiﬁed, including:

1. improving adaptive technologies, especially digital storytelling,

to shape learning experience;

2. providing technological approaches to reduce developments

costs for DEGs, and

research trends

3. developing robust evaluation methodologies for DEGs.

4.4 agreement

Through Serious games Research, researchers and developers attempt

ﬁrst to deliver clear theories about the effectiveness of DEGs and sec-

ond to measure the educational attainment level.

To this issue; Researchers have agreed that:

• “The most gaming studies focus on learning conceptually —

concepts like reasoning, creativity, system understanding and

decision making —, which does not demand special knowledge

of subject areas.” - [87]

• “The nature of games promotes several vital skills for deep learn-

ing, such as metacognition, selective attention, problem solving,

perspective taking, a chance to practice, thinking of alternative

solutions, multiple modularities, multiprocessing, information

literacy and are motivating (Blumberg & Ismailer, 2009; Charsky,

2010; Mason & Rennie, 2008; Davidson, 2008).” - [76]

• “An extensive body of research demonstrates the positive effects

of digital games on child and adolescent players’ learning (Blum-

berg & Ismailer, 2009).” - [76]

• “Serious games are an effective teaching tool that involve 36

learning principles, but not just by virtue of being a game.” -

[56]

• “The use of information visualization systems, interactive tech-

niques and multimedia tools in teaching and learning experi-

ences tends to be effective.

This statement is supported by the fact that these tools can be

effective in improving students’ learning and data retention for

90% of learners when they verbalize something and then imple-

ment it ...” - [47]

• “Contemporary research indicates that educational games have

the potential to improve learning (Srinivasan, Butler-Purry &

Pedersen, 2008) and to increase the likelihood that the desired

4.4 agreement

learning outcomes will be achieved (Pivec & Kearney, 2007).”

• “More speciﬁcally, educational games can improve learning be-

cause they:

– increase motivation (Garris, Ahlers & Driskell, 2002; Lee

& Peng, 2006; Graesser, Chipman, Leeming & Biedenbach,

2009),

– create cognitive conﬂict (Chen, Lien, Annetta & Lu, 2010),

– can improve and enhance visual-spatial perception ability

(Greenﬁeld, Brannon & Lohr, 1994; Lee & Peng, 2006),

– can generate various competencies (such as motor, cogni-

tive, emotional, social, personal, etc.) (Kretschmann, 2010),

– can stimulate intensive mental engagement (Prensky, 2001),

and

– create conditions for better memory retention (Oblinger,

2004; Lee & Peng, 2006).” - [137]

• “Considering children’s natural love for playing games, the grow-

ing availability of electronic media, and the fact that children

spend a great deal of time interacting with electronic media

(Fisch, Lesh, & Motoki, 2009), the educational value of digital

games is very clear.” - [137]

• “The most successful and the most common form of educational

games are the mini games targeting at preschool age and pri-

mary education level children.

These games attempt to help young children to obtain basic skills

such as numbers, letters, simple maths, and reading, offering

entertainment and instruction for their target audience.” - [96]

• “The ﬁndings of empirical studies revealed that instructional

games promoted learners’ attention (Yip & Kwan, 2006), state

of ﬂow (Kiili, 2005b), motivation (Rosas et al., 2003), delayed

retention (Cameron & Dwyer, 2005), mathematics performance

(Ke & Grabowski, 2007; Lopez-Moreto & Lopez, 2007; Shaffer,

1997), knowledge transfer (Shaffer, 2006), decision making (Corsi

research trends

et al., 2006), expert behavior development (VanDeventer & White,

2002), and spatial skills and brain oscillation (Natale, 2002).

In addition, using games created dynamic (Rosas et al., 2003)

and collaborative (Squire, Giovanetto, Devane, & Durga, 2005)

learning environments which positively affected learning.” - [88]

• “By administering external tests, teachers may lose much of

the value of the games since learners are already inherently

demonstrating their knowledge and skills by interactions during

gameplay.

Assessments embedded into games will, in addition, reduce the

often artiﬁcial separation between performance and assessment

in school (Reeves & Okey, 1996).

Each of these approaches has shown that students are learning

in the gaming environment.” - Underwood et al. [189]

4.5 limitations

Serious games are pedagogical multimedia products made to help

learners develop speciﬁc competencies.

Their use has proven to be promising in many domains, but is at

present restricted by the time consuming and costly nature of the

developing process.

When developing Serious Games for academic purposes, not only

is there a budgetary challenge, but there is also the challenge of

integrating enough educational value without sacriﬁcing the fun char-

acteristics, admitted Meyer [126].

Law and Rust-kickmeier [108]have seen the integration of external

resources (e.g., learning media) with a game engine into a coherent

and immersive game environment as difﬁcult.

Since the development and application of immersive DEGs is still at an

early stage, to date no appropriate methodologies exist which enable

an effective integration of existing learning resources and their (re)use

in DEGs.

Hence, it is deemed critical to analyze the technological and didactic

demands and mutual dependencies between learning resources, learn-

ing activities, pedagogical models, and narrative game engines.

An approach of resource harmonization, resource symbolization, and

ontological resource description, should also be established.

• Cost & Time

4.6 skepticism

The development of competitive DEGs is cost-intensive, and the mar-

kets are narrow because DEGs may relate to limited age groups or

speciﬁc curricula.

Thus, the integration of existing learning resources is a crucial aspect

of efﬁcient and cost- effective learning design and game development.

Law and Rust-kickmeier [108]

• Intervening Variables

– “With respect to the relation to the variable of gender and

the variable the ﬁnancial status of the family and the vari-

able of the parents´ educational background and the vari-

able of the parents´ occupation point out to slight differ-

ences in the achievement rate of the students.” - [28]

– “As Squire (2003) discovered, bringing a computer game

into classrooms may raise as many issues as it solves.

* First, playing games does not appeal to every student.

* Second, students may be distracted by game-playing,

and thus, not achieving the learning goals (Miller, Lehman,

& Koedinger, 1999).

* Further, students may fail to extract intended knowl-

edge from a complicated gaming environment (Squire,

2003).

* Finally, game design researchers (Smith & Mann, 2002)

are worried that making games where the objective is

to facilitate students’ learning will risk sacriﬁcing the

game part along the way.” - [87]

4.6 skepticism

The contradicting views of the literature review, the existence of rel-

atively few empirical studies in the reviews, and the cited method-

ological ﬂaws in the empirical studies necessitate further rigorous

empirical study to help educators and instructional designers reach

better conclusions about the effects of instructional games so that

they may better understand, implement, and facilitate the games in

classroom setting.

research trends

As suggested by Van Eck (2006), instructional games would likely

experience widespread development and use if persuasive examples

of empirical studies could show the enhancement of learning by using

instructional games.

“Skeptics toward game-based learning contend that the effectiveness

of computer games on learning is still a mystery.” - [87]

Several major reviews on educational games indicated no clear

causal relationship between academic performance and the use of

computer games.

“According to Hodgson, Man & Leung (2010), the wisdom of using

digital games for learning is debatable, because games are commonly

perceived as tools for having fun. Although games can be effective

learning environments, not all games are effective, nor are all games

educational and beneﬁcial for all learners or for all learning outcomes

(Oblinger, 2006).” - [137]

“A common skepticism on using computer games for learning

purposes lies in the lack of an empirically-grounded framework for

integrating computer game into classrooms.” - [87]

4.7 recommendations for our case study

Serious games researchers, having taken in consideration all the lim-

itations and skepticism encountered in early studies evaluating the

learning effectiveness of a game based laarning, take nowadays more

care of achievement, motivation and fun factors in the gaming experi-

ence.

Quinn [149] have concluded that we should:

“focus more on making the interaction fun or useful—not on the

learning aspects. In our community games, people are thinking,

learning, experimenting, but we don’t point to learning as an

outcome at all. Learning takes place informally in all of the games.”

So, from developers´sight , we should provide a balance between

teacher-assigned and student-selected tasks in the learning content to

assure a funny, motivational and playable game.

Meyer [126] criticised contemporary educational researchers of be-

ing tagged as either positivist or interpretivist, two opposite episte-

mological paradigms in social studies, and proposed an alternative

4.7 recommendations for our case study

methodology which embraces pragmatism, called a Spiral Research

Model.

It incorporates a mixed-methods approach and multiple case stud-

ies in a practical way, in which the research question along with its

changes over time, determines the choice of research methods.

Soren Johnson said:

“no one knows how best to make an interface than someone

who uses it day after day after day.

We play our games a lot, but we can never play them as

much as our fans do.”

B U G G A M E

It’s time for kids to crunch numbers in a fun way!

While math can be an intimidating subject for some kids, there are

plenty of games for kids to enjoy their learning experiences.

The best part is that kids won’t know they are learning because

they’ll be having so much fun playing math games.

These elementary school level math games are a win-win for teach-

ers and parents who want to motivate their kids to sharpen their math

skills!

5.1 game development

In DANCE Research Group, we’re responsible for designing serious

educational iPad games for children. Some of these games are catego-

rized to join the "E&P" series of games. E&P are two actors present in

these games and they’re responsible for children guidance, motivation

and audio feedback.

The games were designed to reinforce academic standards for math-

ematics and target a variety of math skills, such as recognition of

numbers, the right way to write them, making addition/substraction

until 10, 15 or 20, geometry and so on.

This game consists of 5 mini games, an intro game () and an award

game (Ufos). These 5 mini games on Figure 7 on page 40 are the “Rope

Game”, the “Bug Game”, the “Math Labyrinth Game”, the “Torch-

Light Game” and the “Magnet Game”.

There are also two main parts that are designed in parallel to these

mini games. The ﬁrst part is a game framework that is responsible

for putting all the ﬁve mini games together with the intro and the

bonus games to represent the whole big game. The second part, and

the most important, is the adaptivity model for the big game. This

model is responsible for detecting the player’s performance in each

mini game and accordingly increases or decreases the game level.

5.1 game development

Our game would mediate communication through the main charac-

ters in the game, support activity since the child should interact with

the iPad and encourage productive learning through mathematical

tasks.

For the further of the Study, we focus on the Bug Game, Figure 7e

on page 40, with the most manipulable variables.

First, the non adaptive game had Gamelog and score keeping and

employed progressive difﬁculty levels – harder problems were pre-

sented at the higher levels of the game.

5.1.1 Bug Game Story

We worked in Group, Farah George [45] was the developer of the ﬁrst

prototype.

I would present you the game story with his words.

The Bug Game is a serious game used for learning. It should teach

the children counting numbers from 1 to 6.

The game has two kinds of bugs, good and bad bugs. Each bug is

carrying a number of dots on its back.

The two actors, E&P should be holding one or two numbers which

represent the number of dots carried by the good bugs.

The main goal of the game is that the child has to recognize the

numbers held by the actors and count the number of dots carried by

each bug to know whether it is a good or a bad bug.

When the child differentiates between good and bad bugs, he should

be able to save as many good bugs as he can by sending them through

an exit cave before being eaten by the bad bugs. The child wins the

game if he succeeds to save more than half of the good bugs.

The Bug Game has to be developed with a lot of features and

behaviors. Examples of these features are the bugs movement and

animations as well as their behavior when they meet each other.

Moreover, the game should have many adaptable elements that can

be changed easily.

bug game

Consequently, by integrating it with the adaptivity model, the game

should change its behavior and difﬁculty according to the child’s

performance.

The setting is a cave.

Bugs enter the cave through a hole in one corner.

Each bug has a certain number (between one and six) of glowing-

dots on its back.

In the other corner is an exit.

At the bottom left and right corner the two main characters, E&P, are

positioned each holding up a sign showing a different digit between 1

and 6.

Only bugs which have the same number of dots on their back as the

numbers held by E&P are allowed to leave the cave.

The child’s task is to help the good bugs to leave the cave by throw-

ing them towards the exit and prevent the bad bugs from leaving by

squishing them.

If bad bugs hit good bugs they eat them; if they hit each other they

multiply.

Bugs that hit the border of the screen bounce off.

The ﬂying speed of the individual bug depends on the number on

its back – bugs with a higher number are faster.

If a bad bug manages to leave the cave, the game ends.

A score about the number of good ﬂies that left the cave is kept.

Good bugs that leave the cave by chance are counted as well.

Thirty good bugs enter the cave and when they all have left the cave

or been eaten the game ends.

5.1.1.1 Scenarios:

• Scenario A: Saving a Good Bug

A child plays the bug game.

He observes E&P on both sides of the screen.

E. holds a card with the number 4 on it which means that each

bug with the number 4 is a good bug.

The child sees a bug with the number 4, he drags it or sends it

- First Settings for the

- non-adaptive mode!

5.1 game development

to the cave and saves it.

• Scenario B: Interacting with a Bad Bug

A bug with a number different than the ones held by E&P means

that its a bad bug.

The child hits the bug, the bug is splashed and killed.

He drags a bad bug to the cave and saves it or he fails to drag it

far from the cave, the game is over and the child loses.

• Scenario C: Behavior of Bad Bugs

When a bad bug comes near a good one and the child fails

to move them away from each other, they collide, the bad bug

opens its mouth and eats the good bug.

If two bad bugs come near each other and the child fails to move

them away from each other, they collide, the 2 bugs duplicate

and become 4 bugs.

• Scenario D: Winning and Losing the Game

When the child saves all the good bugs or more than half of

them, he wins the game.

When he saves only one bad bug or fails to save more than half

the good bugs, the game is over and he loses.

5.1.1.2 Functional Requirements:

• Good Bugs and Bad Bugs

This game consists of two kinds of bugs, good and bad bugs.

A bug should hold a certain number of dots which are responsi-

ble for the teaching process.

Bugs in this game should be moving through all parts of the

screen, rotating according to the direction of motion and should

be animated in different game situations. A speciﬁc number

of bugs should enter the screen with a pre-determined rate. A

player should be able to hit a bug or drag any bug through any

place on the screen. He should be able to save good or bad bugs

by letting them exit the cave and he can kill bad bugs by hitting

them by his ﬁnger. When a good bug and a bad bug meet each

other, the bad bug should eat the good bug. When two bad bugs

meet each other, they should duplicate to become 4 bugs.

• Multitouch

The game should be a multitouch game so that more than one

player can play together at the same time or a player can play

bug game

with both his hands.

- The mini-game

- should be adaptable!

- First Settings that

- would change after

the evaluation

process!

• Adaptability

This game should be adaptable (not adaptive).

The game should provide a sort of different easy and advanced

behaviors to what is called the adaptive model.

This model is to decide which behavior should be changed, and

when according to the player’s performance during the game.

• E&P

Two main actors sitting on both sides of the screen, E&P.

One of them or both should be holding the number of dots that

are carried by the good bugs.

They should be animated in different game situations.

They should be talking to the player, guiding and motivating

him during the game.

• Winning and Losing

A score of the game, which is equal to the number of saved good

bugs, should be displayed for the player on the screen.

The game should tell the player one of 4 situations that end the

game.

First, when one bad bug exits the cave, the game is over and the

player loses.

Second, when all good bugs are saved, the player wins the game

with full score.

The third situation is that when no more good bugs are there

and the score is less than half the full score, the player loses the

game.

Finally, when no more good bugs are there and the score is more

than or equal half the full score, the player wins the game.

5.1.1.3 Nonfunctional Requirements:

• Usability

Usability is the ease with which a user can interact and operate

with the system.

Since this game is for children, it should be more usable to allow

the child to play understand its purpose and play it easily.

Moreover, usability should be measured by the amount of time

the player should wait to interact with the system and observe

the result of this interaction.

For example, killing a bug shouldn’t take more than 1 second.

5.1 game development

• Reliability

Reliability is an important factor of software quality.

This game has to be reliable meaning that it should run continu-

ously for 1 hour or until the game is over without crashing.

• Performance

A major factor in determining the overall productivity of a sys-

tem, performance is primarily tied to availability, throughput

and response time.

This game should have a good performance. During the game,

there are many good and bad bugs on the screen and many

others entering the screen. The game should handle the motion

and the behavior of all of them. Also, the game should guarantee

the player a quick response for his interaction with it.

He should only wait for 2-3 seconds maximum in some cases

depending on the animations running before the actual result.

This is a similar idea to usability mentioned in subsection 3.4.1

but from the system perspective rather than the player’s perspec-

tive.

Morever, the performance can be measured with the frame-rate.

So the game should have a minimal frame-rate about 30fps in

some cases, and average frame-rate should be between 40 and

60 frames per second (fps).

• Supportability & Extendability

Supportability is all the actions related to the inherent quality of

the system.

To deal with fast changing development requirements, the sys-

tem has to be extensible.

This extensibility could be considered as a part of supportability.

The game should be able to easily integrate current and future

technologies without major modiﬁcations of the existing system.

The game has a lot of elements to be adapted and can be used

by any other system.

An external adaptivity model can be easily connected and inte-

grated with the game such that the game behavior is changed

depending on the player’s performance.

• Implementation Requirements

Implementation requirements are constraints on the implemen-

tation of our target system which specify tools and hardware

platforms to be used.

This game is designed only for iPad and cannot be run on any

other iOS device.

Also, it is restricted that the development of this game is done

and popular frameworks for iOS development.

The game structure offers the option to include adaptivity on different

levels.

The use of adaptivity on the macro level was skipped in order to

include a higher level of control -[78].

This hides the linear structure of the game and gives the player the

feeling that his/her actions have an impact on the game world.

It creates the feeling of playing the game the way he/she wants,

with a sense of agency. This increases the ﬂow experience (Sweetser &

Wyeth, 2005).

The idea of adaptivity through Aptitude-Treatment interaction ap-

proach by dynamically generating the feedback given by the main

characters in the game (E&P) would be a fairly time- and cost-intensive

process.

The necessity of a complex feedback depends strongly on the task.

Tasks which require a complex knowledge and understanding of the

subject require detailed feedback while tasks which primarily serve

for repetitive training — when failure happens mostly due to a lack of

practice — do not require such detailed feedback.

Since the main focus of the game lies in practicing skills learned at

school rather than teaching new content, the need for complex feed-

back is relatively low and therefore was skipped for the time being.

The same applies to the Constructivistic-Collaborative adaptive

approach.

If practical use of the game shows the need for it, adaptive feedback

can relatively easily be added retrospectively -[78].

The current implementation of the game focuses on the implemen-

tation of adaptivity on the micro level.

5.2 adaptivity model

On the level of the particular task (the mini-game) the difﬁculty is

adjusted to the progress the child makes while playing.

Additionally game data is stored and used for the setup of the next

mini-game.

Dynamic difﬁculty adjustment can be achieved through two differ-

ent approaches:

• Game Aspects: all aspects which are not directly linked with the

learning content itself but rather with attributes mainly inﬂuenc-

ing the gaming experience: parameters such as speed or number

and size of the elements presented.

• Learning Content Aspects: the actual learning objectives, the

exercises presented, such as how many tokens to count, or what

numbers to calculate.

The concept of easier and harder Learning Contents and the in-

ﬂuence of their order of presentation is based on the Knowledge

Space Theory -[78].

The Knowledge Space Theory ﬁrst introduced by Doignon and Fal-

magne (1985) is a structural approach towards human knowledge

gaining.

Knowledge Spaces are based on competencies and are somehow

connected with each other and dependent on each other.

The theory categorizes problems, learning objects and skills -[83].

Learning objects are assigned to a set of skills which are relevant

for solving the problems.

Skill functions can be formulated based on the subset of skills

sufﬁcient for a particular problem. Some skills are prerequisites for

others.

This leads to a structure of competence, where each skill is assigned

to a collection of subsets of skills.

Acquiring one skill requires mastering of all skills of at least one of

those underlying subsets of skills -[5].

To sort the Learning Content by difﬁculty the Bavarian ﬁrst grade

curriculum was used as a point of reference (Staatsinstitut für Schulqual-

ität und Bildungsforschung München, 2000).

5.2.2 Model

As i wrote this thesis, the work progresses, and our Models are con-

stantly changing and would, at the latest, in few months in Damir

Ismailovi´c´s ongoing Ph.D. [79] explicitly presented and discussed.

I would present you here the principle of our game architecture,

as shown on Figure 8 on page 48, from the sight of the researchers

of the ELEKTRA Project, an european interactive tutorial game for

educational purposes1.

This work was cited by many Serious Games Reserchers, because

it was the ﬁrst of his art that evoqued and adopted the adaptive ap-

proach in digital games2.

The Game System consists of four modules or engines.

The game engine (GE) provides the non-adaptive parts of the game,

is the user interface to the system and provides information on the

learner’s action in the game to the skill assessment engine (SAE).

The SAE updates the learner model (i.e. the skill state likelihoods).

The resulting information about the learner’s skill state and its

changes are then forwarded to the Educational Reasoner (ER), the

pedagogical part of microadaptivity.

Based on pedagogical rules and learning objectives, the ER gives

recommendations on adaptive interventions to the adaptation realiza-

tion (AR) module which maps the abstractly formulated educational

recommendations onto more concrete game recommendations.

In this mapping process, data on game elements and information

on previously given recommendations are considered.

The game recommendations are then forwarded to the GE which

realises them as concrete adaptive interventions in the game.

In the forward of the thesis, i would focus on the Educational Rea-

soner, which i would redeﬁne, in our ﬁnal Model as Pedagogical

Reasoner, since it would handle both aspects of our game, gaming

and learning elements.

6.1 context of the study

Relying on these two statements;

“Software can be made age appropriate even for children as young as three

or four (NAEYC 1996).” - [194]

&

“Digital devices are the perfect augment. Digital devices can be

programmed to “say” or do anything you want and can execute reliably

and repeatedly. They will remember arbitrary facts, and respond

appropriately to the input you give them every time. However, they are not

particularly good at making decisions or detecting the nuances of a

conversation.” - [149]

Preschool children (4to 8 years old)

We are going to develop a game aimed at small culturally speciﬁc

user populations respecting “the state of the art guidelines” to design-

ing serious games.

6.1.1 Social

When designing software for young children, we should focus on a spe-

ciﬁc age group and try to establish a user proﬁle of typical preschool

gamer including their sociocognitive development, development of

play and the cultural aspects of development, because children of

different ages have vastly different preferences, development factors

and levels of skills.

Although the most research has been done on games for older

children and no guidelines exist, that distinguish between different

age groups, what makes our task as developers and reserchers more

complex, we focus on the 4 to 8 age group for the following reasons:

• Each child is unique and has an individual growth and devel-

opment pattern, personality, temperament, learning style and

background.

The child’s age can therefore be regarded as only a rough index

of developmental status.

learning with

adaptivity

• At this age, children start their schooling experience and appro-

priate products can enhance school readiness and support the

acquisition of cognitive skills such as reading, writing and story

construction.

• Fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination are, at this age,

adequately developed to use digital devices.

6.1.2 Technical

Promising contributions are seen in the ﬁeld of Human Computer

Interfaces and multimodal interfaces, addressing the potential of in-

creased dimensions of multi-touch displays on mobile devices and

natural, gesture-based interaction and control of computers and appli-

cations.

In the last few years digital educational games have gained atten-

tion as a tool for facilitating learning in different sectors of society

including but not limited to military, health, and education.

A number of factors have made Digital Educational Games´ attrac-

tive learning tools.

The advancement of technology has made it possible to play games

on simple platforms such as mobile devices, provided children with

opportunities for engaging in activities associated with computers and

since the use of new technological and learning methods has prooved

an improvement of the learning process, a wide range of software has

been designed with young children in mind.

With an iPad application, we’re reaching a speciﬁc user demo-

graphic, but if the demographic makes sense, this is an attractive

platform because of its mobility, crisp graphics, gestural interface, and

other unique interface elements.

The iPad has quickly become a prime platform for advergames and

persuasive games, and more robust serious games and simulations

are being developed for it.

The gestural interface and accelerometer open the door for innova-

tive new applications. Because of its handheld nature, certain serious

games and simulations can seem even more immersive.

6.2 my evaluation framework

6.2 my evaluation framework

6.2.1 Rigor of the Study

The rigor of the study is important in order to generate credible and

trustworthy theories and results.

Projects need clear objectives that describe what they aim to do and

how they will do it. In general, the clearer the objectives, the easier they

will be to measure. If it is not clear what the project is trying to achieve,

it will not be possible to measure whether or not it has been successful.

The typical evaluations encountered in my literature review have

adopted the principle of prooﬁng the positive effects of serious gaming

on the learning experience and neglected the fact that the integration

of learning content within games need to be well analyzed from the

pedagogical, psychological and pragmatical point of vue.

The functional requirements are the business functions that the

system is to perform. The requirements in our game should also be

met after enabling the adaptive mode, what led us conduct such an

evaluation.

6.2.2 Restatement of the objectives and Research Questions of the Study

Our Study doesn´t aim at contributing to the understanding and mea-

suring whether digital games can be considered suitable and effective

tools for enhancing learning.

Then this has been already discussed and ensured through the

contributions of other researchers on Serious Games during the last

decade.

Gone from the emotions of the child, which are observed (effect),

we search for the reason/trunk (cause) of success and/or failure. The

cause can be part either of the GameAspect, or of the LearningCon-

tentAspect; which should be adapted accordingly to player needs.

6.2.3 Logic Model

Admitting that a process evaluation needs to be considered right at

the start, and built into a project’s logic model to attain Speciﬁc, Mea-

surable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound objectives. We adopted

this principle and integrated our evaluation into the implementation

Figure 9: Cause-Cause-Effect

process of the game.

We applied qualitative research methods by interviewing experts

and by observing children while playing.

We iteratively developed a serious game with experts (pedagogics,

psychologists, professional game-developers, serious game researchers,

students and players).

During the development process we carried out informal, conversa-

tional interviews with all participants in every iteration.

The constructed game helped us to to provide examples to the given

questions, and helped the experts to reﬂect about given answers.

Additionally we used this serious game to observe children while

playing, for being able to provide more data for the experts.

Finally we executed retrospective interviews with experts based on

the given work with them.

The process can be repeated for the other mini-games.

An overview of the steps of the study is given on Figure 10 on page

55 and Figure 11 on page 56.

6.2.4 Evaluation Design

- Implementation &

- Process Evaluation

There are a lot of different deﬁnitions of evaluation.

Here is one of the best, because it touches on the most important

aspects of evaluation:

“Evaluation is a collection of methods, skills and sensitivities

necessary to determine whether a human service is needed and likely

![Im14](images/Im14)

6.2 my evaluation framework

Figure 10: Study Overview

![Im15](images/Im15)

my methodology

Figure 11: Study Overview 2

![Im16](images/Im16)

6.2 my evaluation framework

to be used, whether it is conducted as planned, and whether the

human service actually does help people” (Posavac and Carey, 1980,

p.6).

This deﬁnition encompasses the two main types of evaluation: pro-

cess and summative.

The evaluative purpose of social work research actually encom-

passes all three of the preceding purposes namely exploration, de-

scription, and explanation of the encountered social phenomena.

Since we would evaluate a game prototype, it is unrealistic to aim to

determine the learning effectiveness through the game. And since we

are at a phase, when we would change the game from non-adaptive

to adaptive and more individual in order to increase the learning

experience and to make the game events more challenging.

We would focus more speciﬁc on the effect of micro adaptive inter-

ventions such as cognitive hints related to the skill assessment of the

learner and motivational hints related to the motivational assessment

of the learner.

Since our game would be adaptive, depending on who is playing

and how much skills does she/he have, I have chosen to adopt the

qualitative approach in my evaluation to investigate the immediate

and long term impact of the dynamic scaffolding adjustments made

on the skills and events levels of the inspected game.

Due to the nature of serious games, generally, and their psycho-

logical and pedagogical backgrounds, and especially our game with

mathematical content, the study would answer the questions related

to the pedagogical agents incorporated in the gaming experience.

Rubin and Babbie [159] admitted, in this issue, that:

“we do not need to choose one camp or the other. Each approach is

useful and legitimate.

Each makes its unique contribution to inquiry.

Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Each is a set of tools, not an ideology.

Researchers need to match the tools they use with the research

questions and conditions they face using quantitative methods for

some studies, qualitative methods for others, and both methods in

combination for still others.”

Whether we should emphasize qualitative or quantitative research

methods depend on the conditions and purposes of our inquiry.

Why have I choosedthe QualitativeApproach?

my methodology

Qualitative methods may be more suitable when ﬂexibility and

deeper understanding are required to study a new phenomenon about

which we know very little, or when we seek to gain insight into the

subjective meanings of complex phenomena to advance our conceptu-

alization of them and build theory that can be tested in future studies.

6.2.5 Site Selector & Participants Selection

We have chosen to visit children at their home, play yard and even at

kindergarten.

Our sample was not great in comparaison to other studies, because

we search not to test the effectiveness of our serious game in teaching

mathematical basics (recognizing numbers, counting in the case of the

Bug Game).

The ages of the participants varied from 3 to 8 years. Their math

abilities were classiﬁed into four levels – advanced, proﬁcient, basic,

and below basic based on the estimations of their parents and/or

teachers.

Participants were questioned on their prior gaming experience and

even more precisely, their experience with tablets (in our case Apple´s

iPad).

For all, even if they had experience with these devices or not, we

trained them the basic skills, in order to better wield the iPad.

Then we hield one orientation session to familiarize them with the

gaming environment and were trained them to do think-aloud;

“a strategy in which participants verbalize aloud while interacting

with computer games, thus modeling the cognitive and affective

processes of game-playing.” - [87]

6.2.6 Data Collection instruments

As Plato already ensured:

“Watch a man at play for an hour and you can learn more about him than

in talking to him for a year” (Plato, 427-348 v.Chr.).

The best way to collect information about the player (e.g. a child

playing a serious game) is to observe him playing. - [78]

6.2 my evaluation framework

Observational studies are widespread used, especially among aca-

demics.

They don’t require an experimental design and allow greater under-

standing of the pathways to change (tests conceptual framework), but

confounding factors (understanding emotions) would be difﬁcult to

rule out.

In our case, we would observe childrens´behaviors, verbal and non-

verbal, facial expressions during gameplay and simulatanely record

them for later analysis through pedagogues, psychologues and experts.

6.2.6.1 Video Material Permission from Parents

Our study would be videotaped, since we rely on the experts´ inter-

pretation. Therefor participants and their parents have been told that:

• the play sessions will be videotaped;

• the cassettes will be coded so that no personally identifying

information is visible on them;

• they will be kept in a secure place (Chair for Applied Software

Engineering, TUM);

• they will be viewed only for research purposes;

• they will be erased after they are transcribed or coded.

7.1 evaluation process

It would be an iterative process, as mentionned in our logic model on

Figure 10 on page 55, since we would over and over adjust the game

by integrating the collected results.

7.1.0.2 Phase I: Experts´Interviews (RQs)

We conducted personal, semi-structered and open interviews with

experts at once to answer our Research Questions (1-5).

The questions varied from general statements about serious games

until speciﬁc questions related to the adaptive mode of our game.

7.1.0.3 Phase II: Play Observation (Game Situations)

With the aid of experts, we were able to deﬁne different Levels of

challenge in the game related to whose playing it.

We built Game Situations, (Easy, Medium, challenging and Difﬁ-

cult), and according to the age of the player and his mathematical

knowledge level, we tried to assign him/her the right challenging

level / Game Situation accomodated to his / her needs and abilities.

A group of helpers were mobilised to measure the impact of each

proposed level on a group of children (Enjoyment or annoyment), a

second one to measure the time taken for each level or until the ﬁrst

disenjoyment/angryness per child.

As intended, we would extract the effective time before activating

the adaptive mode and the best time to switch between levels prede-

ﬁned from the experts.

7.2 experts´ interviews

The aim of the interviews with experts is to gain insight into their

opinion about how freely could we adapt the game, the settings that

The interviewees (Table 1 on page 64) ranged from Psychologues,

Pedagogues, Math Teachers to game designers from the Chair for

Applied Software Engineering - TUM. All of the interviewees had a

clear and detailed understanding of both scenarios and requirements

of the game.

We contacted the experts one week earlier, send them the scenarios

and requirements of the game being evaluated and the game itself, so

that they could try and generate ﬁrst impressions and ideas.

Before the interview started the purpose of this research was ex-

plained. Subsequently, consent was asked for recording the interview

and each of the experts have had the game in front of him to simulate

the situations discussed.

“Bad games have little challenge, or too much challenge. Good

How would we, by means of Adaptivity, adjust the challenge in

the Game within the Game ﬂow Corridor?

• How would we ensure an individual and continuous Gameplay

through the Flow Channel?

• How would we vary the adaptive variables, without annoying

children or without affecting both Gameplay and Challenge?

• When should we activate the adaptive mode? (To deﬁne after

• Which variable should we adjust and how much?

• What are the difﬁculties in the given game example, and how

they relate to different skills necessary in the game?

We enlisted the help of several different kinds of experts to acquire

and set up the settings for the adaptive mode that assure a reasonnable

amount of difﬁculty and motivation in the Game.

Such interviews might not be high on a hierarchy designed to de-

termine objectively the effects of the intervention of Adaptivity, but

would be high on a hierarchy designed for generating in-depth in-

sights about children’s perceptions, feelings and attitudes.

Interview Results

In the ﬁrst interviews we explicitly asked abstract questions to the

experts, and did not go into detail regarding our game, in order to

build us a whole idea, how experts handle the pedagogical and psy-

chological aspects of serious games and for eventually provident help.

In the next step we focused on our game especially:

1. to identify the game elements and learning content that are re-

lated to adaptivity.

5. to relate these skills to events and tasks in the game, where they

can be learned from.

A variety of events can take place during the process of the game as

declared in Table 2 on page 67.

Some of them are system autonomous and the others rely on the

activity of the player.

The study provided detailed description of tasks and events that

can be adapted.

We speciﬁed six elements which could be adaptable:

• The quantity of number-signs held by Emil and Pauline, which

indicate good bugs, can vary between one and two.

• The bugs can be adjusted in regard to their speed and color.

• The consequence of two bad bugs hitting each other is either

none or they multiply.

• Whether bad bugs can leave the cave on their own.

• Which bug is to appear.

• The amount of bugs currently on the screen, and the percentage

of good and bad bugs currently entering.

• The digits on bugs can be either arranged as they are on a dice

or have a random arrangement.

The following variables, Table 3 on page 68, can be applied indepen-

dently and customized, to meet the individual child’s standard.

Further we identiﬁed four game situations with various difﬁculties,

which are age derived. These, in the traditional jargon of games, called

levels, could be easily switched to easier or harder mode, as the player

needs.

7.2 experts´ interviews

• Level 1 (for 3-5 years)

– Number-sign: One good number

– Encounter of bad bugs: no multiplication

Assuming that the tutor characterizes the learner by recognizing her /

his skills, we identiﬁed the skills required for all scenarios of the game

and differentiate between those related to the game elemets and those

related to the learning content as shown on Table 4 on page 71.

Some of the Adapt Events manipulate and inﬂuence the difﬁculty

of Learning Content Aspects others the difﬁculty of Game Aspects as

shown on Table 5 on page 71.

To summerize the results:

We now have data concerning the difﬁculty of the learning content

and game elements.

There are game elements that need to be adapted, to make the game

easier or harder.

Some of them are related to the learning content, and other not.

The learning content is segmented in task-sets.

Each set has a skill associated to it.

One of the conclusions we drawed here is that the game elements in

form of adaptable properties can be used to increase or decrease difﬁ-

culty and that they affect some skills when the difﬁculty is changed.

7.3.1 Tricky Emotions

- Fostering emotional

- literacy in young

- children is the next

complex task

When observing children, we may encounter difﬁculty, trying to un-

derstand children´s emotions.

There are many factors that impact our ability to understand chil-

dren´s emotions like the body language, the tone of voice, the facial

expressions and the psychological responses (laughing, ...).

The ability of labeling emotions consists in identifying (Which emo-

tions do the following faces express?), understanding (How do you

know?) and responding to them in a healthy manner and this is hard

to manage because:

• all emotions are valid; it is how we interpret them that counts,

• emotions may change through the experiment,

• children can have more than one emotion about the game state,

and

• we can feel differently than someone else about the same emo-

tion.

Let we consider the Figure 12 on page 73;

We could identify 6 principle states of emotions in young age going

from:

• happy

• sad

• embarrassed

• scared

• nervous

7.3 observation

• mad

and for each state we could identify the corresponding facial expres-

sions and the clues that experience that:

• Happy - smiling

• Sad - frowning

• Embarrassed - cheeks, lips, eyes rolled

• Scared - mouth opened, eyes wide

• Nervous - sweating, teeth, eyebrows

• Mad - tight mouth, eyebrows

7.3.2 Results

The observation gave us, but especially, experts ideas, how children

are doing with the game situations they proposed.

Deeper we identiﬁed:

1. if they are age adequate?

2. Where do they have problems understanding the game or game

elemets?

3. the average time taken per level?

7.3.2.1 Bug Game: Game Situations

As suggested from experts, we made some changes to the game and

built the proposed Game Situations as mapped [EASY] Table 6 on

variables non-adaptive, even predeﬁned namely:

• Bugs on the screen (no more as 8)

• New bugs entering (no more as 4)

• Maximum Duplication of bad bugs (Limit to 8)

Claims have been done about the correlation between adaptive vari-

ables, so freely isn´t it?

• The factor Duplication, factor Speed and factor Collision corre-

late together;

So if we adjust one of them, we should be aware of the others,

in order to mainatain the ﬂow.

• If we differentiate the color of bugs, the speed should be rela-

tively higher.

These considerations have been concluded and taken in consideration

for future work.

7.3.2.2 What Claims can be observed from the impact of game adaptation

Although we differentiated ﬁrst between game and learning elements,

while building the game situations we played with both as a whole.

The ﬁrst observations were difﬁcult, since children, some of them,

have not understood the goal of the game.

We observed that:

• Some only squash bad bugs (They enjoyed that, since it was an

easy task).

• Others, who understood the learning task, concentrated only on

saving good bugs, neglected the squash task (They were rapidly

annoyed, since bad bugs duplicated and heva eaten good bugs).

• Others needed help to differentiate between good and bad bugs

and enjoyed only the ﬁrst Game Situations.

The interaction between game and learning elements has shown that,

if coherent, this produces the most of the gaming experiencce and let

children immersed, since they enjoy gameplay.

Experts rebuked us to use also appropriate audio feedback and to

build a new-gamer-tutorial to guide the new player through the game

story.

D I S C U S S I O N

8.1 scientific evidence

The scientiﬁc evidence stems from the ZPD and Flow theories com-

bined together.

The Learner ZPD Evaluator model is constructed based on the ZPD

theory as shown on Figure 13 on page 82.

Performing a hard or simple task with inadequately developed skills

or with high-order skills pushs the learner accordingly either in the

zone of confusion or in the zone of boredom and automatically neglect

efﬁcient learning.

Through the Trial&Error principle or with adequate pedagogical

support, the learner could increase his skill level himself and so per-

form the task easier.

If the learner lies in the zone of boredom, the system should be

able to shift him back to the ZPD zone, by adapting the game and/or

learning elements to a more challenging and motivational state.

8.2 restatement of the research question

The intention from this evaluation is neither to gather data such as

video material or experts interviews for further analysis with statistical

analysis software nor to develop charts mentioning the success of the

developed game.

The intention, due to the evaluation period during implementation,

is to develop theories from the hypotheses that describe the impact of

the adaptive mode.

Keeping in mind the theories of Gameplay, Learning through play,

Game Flow, Learning through Try&Error, Vygotsky’s theories of indi-

vidual ZPD & Scaffolding;

If we would adapt, we should be aware of all of these theories, better

said, we would adapt individually to the needs of the player playing

the game at the moment.

In this scope would Adaptivity play an innovative and efﬁcient role

while accompaining the player through his gaming experience, keep-

ing him out of the routine and frustration states, letting him immersed

in the game and so producing the best learning outcome.

summary that systematically answer your research

questions

Experts´ interviews acted as validating instrument for the pedagogical

patterns in the game.

These were than deepenend by in-ﬁeld obseravation to approach

the issues of reliability and validity.

The explanation of the phenomena constructed the “justiﬁed true

belief’”, which is the perceived knowledge which supports the foun-

dation of the conclusions of this research.

This evaluation ensured the validity of the pedagogical reasoner

module to deﬁne general and variable-speciﬁc rules that would garantie

a continuous and immersed gameplay within th optimal adaptivity

corridor as shown on Figure 14 on page 83.

discussion

8.4 conclusion

If we adapt, we should be aware of the Game Flow, we should adapt

individually, with just the right amount and responding to the actual

needs of the player.

Making the Events and the Tasks more complex would motivate

and encourage the child, otherwise, if too hard, that would interrupt

the gamplay and annoy the child.

8.4.1 Contribution

Serious Games Researchers are starting to realize that integrating

assessments into gaming environments is important and that external

multiple-choice questionnaires and human-scored artifacts are not

sufﬁcient to assess all that people may be learning in games, since the

latter are time-wise inefﬁcient and do not scale easily.

Kickmeier-rust et al. [95] afﬁrm that:

Considering the importance of not destroying immersion with the

game, the assessment of the learning progress and

psycho-pedagogical feedback must occur in a non-invasive way. This

requires an intelligent system that is capable of assessing individual

competencies and learning progress by observing and interpreting

behaviour within the game.

Underwood et al. [189]1 ensure that:

The time is ripe to create educational gaming environments since

technology is now available to integrate assessments and implement

data collection and adaptivity in near real-time. We have developed a

set of capabilities to design and integrate assessments into games,

visualize and analyze data, and individually adapt games.

Additionally, we are continuing to research and develop methods for

making inferences about behavior and learning in gaming

environments. Embedded assessments that are truly integrated into

the design of the game provide learners with the opportunity to

immediately learn from their mistakes. In order to take advantage of

this idea, we must design games to integrate opportunities for

learners to display the skills they are intended to learn, allowing the

learner to enjoy and experiment with trial and error without

interrupting gameplay.

1 (http://www.pr-sol.com/)

8.4 conclusion

Chen and Michael [23] reassure that:

Because serious games have not yet been shown to be effective

(Federation of American Scientists, 2006), the adoption in education

of games is slow, regardless their engaging approaches to learning.

One way to show they are effective is to measure the learning that

occurs during play.

As recommended from serious games researchers of the last decade,

21st century serious games will rely on in-game data and sense made

of this data — No small task to be sure —, to enable the dynamic

delivery of new, individualized information and activity into the game.

Incorporating assessment systems into serious games would track

learner/player behavior over time, validate game objectives and im-

prove individual success.

The result is an improvement in overall engagement and educational

impact for the individual learner and clearer snapshot of game impact

for the development team.

8.4.2 Consideration for Bug Game

From a technical point of view, the major challenge is ﬁrst to merge

gaming and learning methodologies and technologies, second to de-

velop high quality educational games in order to meet the high expec-

tations of learners in terms of quality in graphics, sound, gameplay

and pedagogical and didactic aspects.

In this game it might be additionally interesting to monitor which

bugs the actions are being performed with?

Whether the child is reacting equally to each number or for example

prefers simple numbers like one or two;

Or whether a child is only reacting to numbers that have a bigger

difference to each other (e.g. if the good bugs are those with three dots

on their back: Is he/she only squashing bad bugs with one or six dots,

because they are easier to distinguish? That might indicate that he /

she is using recognition rather than counting.).

The Game Events correlate with the Task Events.

Some are directly induced by a Task Event, others are consequential.

discussion

A high amount of good bugs eaten and bad bugs escaped by chance

will show a negative correlation with the number of bugs squashed.

A high amount of good bugs escaped by chance will show a positive

correlation.

We experimented with few samples of children, have deﬁned gen-

eral game situations settings that would ensure the game ﬂow depend-

ing on the right association skill level and child/gamer;

But even if the game situation at the moment presents a suitable

difﬁculty for the child playing it, after some hours enjoying the game,

it would be annoying, if we don´t switch to another game situation

more complex;

The question here is when should we switch?

Should we make it more difﬁcult or more easier?

Depending on who´s playing? What skills does he / she have?

How would we switch individually?

As a result from the experts´interviews and interpretation of the

recorded observational material helped us to develop a preliminary

theory of adaptive factors affecting user satisfaction, their correla-

tion with each others and their impact on children´s motivation and

achievement.

These two factors have benn analyzed as dependent variables, ef-

fects and auto-reaction to the stimulus of adaptivity

As we would, in the future, track the player over time, some changes

related to the Game Log should be conducted.

• Score: Until this evaluation time, the score was calculated only

by means of saved good bugs;

This is not enough, if we would track the actions of the player

all the time.

We would adopt the new score calculation on the basis of this

– [+1 if good bug saved]

– [-1 if bad bug exits]

– [-2 if bad bugs doubled]

8.5 recommendation for future research

• Time: the time for a game session of 60 bugs, after observation

of 10 children, have been averaged to 3 minutes.

This should be integrated in the score. For players who spend

more than 3 minutes, the score should decrease every 30 seconds.

Therfore three additional variables should be added into the system.

These will be, in addition to the score calculation, responsable for a

better interpretation of the activity of the player.

• Eat Quote: to identify, if the player really plays, and squashs the

bag bugs;

• Exit Quote: to idetify, if bad bugs exit;

• Squash Quote: to interpret the interactivity of the player and his

reaction speed;

8.5 recommendation for future research

As a recommendation for future evaluation and in order to let experts

interact live with the players into the game although without inter-

rupting or letting the gamer feel that some one is changing the game

artefacts while he / she plays, we imagined a test solution, called

“RemoteEqualizerTool”, shown on Figure 15 on page 88, consisting of

two iPads, facilitating us the remote control of the adaptive variables

wirelessly while playing.

The interest relies in tasks that have been characterized as “Remote

Help Giving” (Tolmie et al., 2004) or “Remote Scaffolding” (Taha, 2012)

where one of the collaborators has the task knowledge and one of the

collaborators manipulates the task artefacts.

As far as is known that:

“Learning is often characterized in terms of the relationship between

Instructor and Learner with the Instructor either passing on

knowledge or creating an environment for the Learner that is rich for

self-discovery (e.g. Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development,

Vygotsky, 1978; Bransford et al., 2000).” - [97]

8.5 recommendation for future research

during instruction, the expert should be able to deﬁne the limits of

understanding of the Learner, they must successfully pass on knowl-

edge and they must be able to competently assess that the Learner has

understood.

a.2 observation screenshots

Figure 16 on the facing page shows us the Eat Animation (5 goob bugs

& 3 bad bugs).

Figure 17 on page 100 exposes us an observed state where children

missunderstood the task and focused only on saving good bugs and

neglected the Sqush task which should be enough engaging through

the animations, this event brings with.

Figure 18 on page 101 points out the Duplication Event, where two

bad bugs collide, they duplicate and become four bad bugs.

This should motivate the player to squash them ﬂat.

Figure 19 on page 102 displays the Exit event, when good bugs are

being saved and throwed through the exit, or when bad bugs escape.

Figure 20 on page 103 exposes us the situation, where the child

wasn´t quick enough to save all good bugs or squash all bad bugs.

Figure 21 on page 104 features an advanced gamer, that was stronger

than our estimations and played perfect our Advanced Game Situation.

He managed all required tasks quicker than us, developers of the

game.

He broked all our ﬁrst results and led us to further considerations.

Nevertheless, ﬁgure 22 on page 105, offers an unexpected situation,

a situation that we haven´t observed as often as possible, namely;

A player who squashs only bad “red” bugs.

This doesn´t disregard the fact, that he dismissed the task, and ne-

glected the saving task, which is the concept of the game story (Saving

bugs through the exit of the cave).

Finally, ﬁgure 23 on page 106, shares a score of 25 saved bugs and

at the end of the game there was no more bugs on the screen.

This pointed out at the fact that the number of bugs should be

relatively higher than 60, to offer a continuous play.

A.3 questionnaire protocols

a.3 questionnaire protocols

• Did you like the game?

• Was it challenging?

• What was your favorite level?

• Was the game fun?

• Was the game too easy?

• Was the game too hard?

• Was the game easy to learn?

• Are the controls intuitive?

• Is the interface clear and easy to navigate?

• Rate yourself on a scale of one to ten.

• Rate how fun playing was.

The answers may make the game designers feel good and may indicate

that the players will at least play the game, but they do not assess the

behavioral change that takes place, and they do not tell you that the

players have learned from the game.

We used the Questionnaire — already designed by Christina Kold

[101] —, actually with the aim of a later formative evaluation, but

since we observed, the goal from them was the same.
