\chapter*{Markdown}

Markdown support, first introduced in Texpad 1.6.2 has been improved, Markdown exists on an equal footing to LaTeX in Texpad.  Create and edit projects just as you would a LaTeX.  There is no need to typeset, simply press the preview button, and the project will be retypeset if and only if the document has changed.

With Texpad you now have the convenience of Markdown along with TeX's suitability to typesetting large and beautiful documents.  If at any time you want the TeX version of your Markdown document you can find it in the same folder as the original Markdown.
