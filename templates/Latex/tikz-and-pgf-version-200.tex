:Title: TikZ and PGF version 2.00
:slug: pgf-version-2
:Tags: PGF 2.0, Manual
:Grid: 3x3


PGF version 2.0 was released on 2008-02-20 after a few months of hectic activity in CVS and on the `pgf-users`_ mailing list. The release is packed with new features
and improvements. 


Revamped system for handling options and styles
-----------------------------------------------

PGF now ships with the new ``pgfkeys`` package. The package provides a powerful key-value management mechanism


Decorations
-----------

Decorations are a new and powerful way of decorating and morphing paths. They are similar to the "snakes" from previous versions of PGF, but much more powerful and general. Here are a few highlights:

- Arbitrary paths can be decorated, including curves and nodes
- Shapes can be used as decorations
- Decorations can be nested


Here are a few examples:

.. figure:: #pgf2001.png

.. sourcecode:: latex

    % Decorating a node shape
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node [text width=2cm, decorate, decoration=saw, fill=blue!20,draw,circle]
            {Node shapes can be decorated!};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    
.. sourcecode:: latex

    % Text decorations
    \usetikzlibrary{decorations.text}
    ...
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \path [decorate,decoration={text along path,
            text={Decorations can draw text that follows an arbitrary curve}}]
            (0,0) sin (1,1) cos (2,0) sin (3,-1) cos (4,0) sin (7,-1);
    \end{tikzpicture}


.. sourcecode:: latex

    % Footprints!
    \usetikzlibrary{decorations.footprints}
    ...
    \begin{tikzpicture}[decoration={footprints,foot length=20pt}]
        \fill [decorate] (0,0) to[bend left] (7,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}

% What is new?

%%- New node shapes
%%
%%- Added overlay functionality to \node.
%%- Added pgfkeys and its documentation.
%%- Added fitting library.
%%
%%- \foreach will now allow a macro name to be given as list
%%      argument (as in \foreach \x in \mylist {...})
%%
%%- Added fadings.
%%    - Added functional shadings.
%%
%%- Added shadow library, removed shadow shapes (no longer
%%      needed).
%%    - Added preaction and postaction options (very useful).
%%    - Added transform canvas option.
%%    - Added scale around option.
%%
%%Coordinates like (2,3cm) are now allowed. Has the same
%%      effect as ([shift={(2,0)}]0pt,3cm), which is what everybody
%%      would expect.
%%
%%- Added decorations documentation.
%%Added calc library and ($...$) notation for coordinates
%%Added through library
%%Added tutorial for geometric constructions.
%%    - Fixed partway and intersection computations.
%%    - Added line to circle intersection.
%%
%%Finished chains and chain tutorial.
%%-positioning library
