## Personal Statement
I work with technologists, creatives and spreadsheet-wielders to create great ideas, great plans and great products. I get the right stuff done. I bring to the table huge enthusiasm, a cool head, a knack for articulating and a driven, goal oriented attitude.

## Experience

### Product Manager, theguardian.com
**The Guardian, London, full-time, 03/2013 - present.** Responsibility for all content on theguardian.com.

* Working closely with editorial, commercial and digital stakeholders up to the most senior levels to evolve the product strategy.
* Day to day ownership of what gets worked on and the quality of what we ship.
* Managing a cross-disciplinary team of UX, engineering and design.


### Technology Analyst
**HoWoCo, London, full-time, 12/2011 - 12/2012.** Full-service digital agency. Key clients were BT, National Grid, WGSN and LexisNexis.

* Writing functional and technical specifications for digital products. Liaising with clients, account managers, designers and developers to ensure quality and consistency across the delivery. With fashion forecasters WGSN, I was the client-facing technical lead for an iPhone and iPad application and supporting API and CMS. The product since won an Outstanding Achievement award at the Interactive Media Awards.
* Presenting to senior client stakeholders on digital strategy, SEO and social. During our work with BT on their sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympics, I delivered a number of presentations to director-level boardrooms on the state of BT's digital presence and potential avenues for building engagement.
* Mentoring junior developers and overseeing the work of third parties to promote high technical standards.
* Researching emerging technologies and developing mockups and internal tools to stay abreast of engineering trends. For a National Grid internal comms project I created a proof of concept Javascript-heavy rich user interface prototype that became the blueprint for a full implementation.


### Software Engineer
**Academia.edu, San Francisco, fixed-term contract, 06/2011 - 09/2011.** Writing Ruby for social network startup based out of San Francisco. Taught me a lot about what makes a good startup and what makes a good engineer.

## Current Projects

### hackerb.io

[hackerb.io](hackerb.io) - The web application that generated this resume. A Rails 3.1 project leveraging API's from LinkedIn and Github and the awesome Prawn Ruby PDF library.
### cantl.in

[cantl.in](cantl.in) - My personal home page and blog.

## Skills
I still write the odd bit of code. Ad-hoc Ruby scripts, SQL, quick and dirty Rails apps, Google Apps Script (otherwise known as Javascript you can write in a spreadsheet), etc. My GitHub profile is over at [github.com/cantlin](https://github.com/cantlin).

I'm also comfortable with the odd bit of Photoshop or Logic or Final Cut, which turns out to be weirdly useful more often than you'd think.

## Education

### B.A. Visual Communication
**Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh.** 



## Interests
Besides making cool stuff with computers, I collect Penguin Books ([todayspenguins.tumblr.com](http://todayspenguins.tumblr.com)), listen to great deal of music ([last.fm/user/cantlin](http://last.fm/users/cantlin)), drive a treasured old Saab 900 and play guitar, banjo and old
Blizzard games.

I've lived in Edinburgh, Seattle and San Francisco in the past, and am presently a proud resident of Hackney, East London.
